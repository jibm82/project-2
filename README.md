# This is Bloodmap
Bloodmap is a country-wide database where patients urgently looking for blood, and active blood donating campaigns can access to our database and connect with the registered blood donors in their vicinity.

## How it works
Active blood donors have to register and create a profile with some basic information. Based on the User's geolocation, a map with the information where active donation campaigns and patients that are currently looking for blood will be displayed.

A blood donation campaign can be set up by simply adding up the patient/campaign information. Bloodmap will take in the address where blood is needed as well as the specific blood type(s) requested and cross-check this information with our database. After that is done, only matching donors will receive an email alert with the details of the campaign.

## Why we need this
There is an increase in the usage of social networks sites across the world, these sites are being used to request all kind of things. Blood donation is no exception, since there is a steady increase in blood donation requests as being noticed in the number of posts on these sites such as Facebook and Twitter seeking blood donors.

Finding blood donors is a challenging issue in almost every country. We feel like there should be a dedicated site for this type of requests, to generate a dedicated channel for this purpose.
